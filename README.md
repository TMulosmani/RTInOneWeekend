# Ray Tracer

This is a C++ project where I go through Peter Shirley's series "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"

Ray Tracing is how most 3D films, simulations, and visual art is rendered. Ray tracing is where you shoot a ray into a scene containing objects, and it tells the camera how they should look based on the lighting of the scene. 

I learned about ray tracing from TUWiens course on Ray Tracing, and used Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" series to learn about how to code it.

It was fun to learn about C/C++ in this project, as I work with Python more nowadays.
